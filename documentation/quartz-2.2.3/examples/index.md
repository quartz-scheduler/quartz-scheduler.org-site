# Examples Overview

Welcome to the documentation for the Quartz Example programs.   As of version 1.5, Quartz ships with 13 out-of-the-box examples that demonstrate the various features of Quartz and the Quartz API.


## Where to Find the Examples {#ExamplesOverview-WheretoFindtheExamples}

All of the examples listed below are part of the Quartz distribution.

To download Quartz, visit <a href="/downloads">http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/download</a> and select the latest Quartz distribution.

The quartz examples are listed under the **examples** directory under the main Quartz directory.  Under the **examples** directory, you will find an example sub-directory for each example, labeled **example1**, **example2**, **example3** etc...

Every example contains UNIX/Linux shell scripts for executing the examples as well at Windows batch files.   Additionally, every example has a readme.txt file.  Please consult this file before running the examples.

The source code for the examples are located in package **org.quartz.examples**.   Every example has its own sub-package, **org.quartz.examples.example1**, **org.quartz.examples.example2**, etc...

Here we give an overview of each example program:
