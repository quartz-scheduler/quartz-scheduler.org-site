## Lesson 6: CronTrigger

CronTrigger is often more useful than SimpleTrigger, if you need a job-firing schedule that recurs based on
calendar-like notions, rather than on the exactly specified intervals of SimpleTrigger.

With CronTrigger, you can specify firing-schedules such as "every Friday at noon", or "every weekday and 9:30
am", or even "every 5 minutes between 9:00 am and 10:00 am on every Monday, Wednesday and Friday during January".

Even so, like SimpleTrigger, CronTrigger has a ***startTime*** which specifies when the schedule is in
force, and an (optional) ***endTime*** that specifies when the schedule should be discontinued.

### Cron Expressions {#TutorialLesson6-CronExpressions}

***Cron-Expressions*** are used to configure instances of CronTrigger. Cron-Expressions are strings
that are actually made up of seven sub-expressions, that describe individual details of the schedule. These
sub-expression are separated with white-space, and represent:

1. Seconds
1. Minutes
1. Hours
1. Day-of-Month
1. Month
1. Day-of-Week
1. Year (optional field)



An example of a complete cron-expression is the string *"0 0 12 ? * WED"* &#45; which means "every
Wednesday at 12:00:00 pm".

Individual sub-expressions can contain ranges and/or lists. For example, the day of week field in the previous
(which reads "WED") example could be replaced with "MON-FRI", "MON,WED,FRI", or even "MON-WED,SAT".

Wild-cards (the '*' character) can be used to say "every" possible value of this field. Therefore the '*'
character in the "Month" field of the previous example simply means "every month". A '*' in the Day-Of-Week field would
therefore obviously mean "every day of the week".

All of the fields have a set of valid values that can be specified. These values should be fairly obvious - such
as the numbers 0 to 59 for seconds and minutes, and the values 0 to 23 for hours. Day-of-Month can be any value 1-31,
but you need to be careful about how many days are in a given month&#33; Months can be specified as values between 0 and
11, or by using the strings JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV and DEC. Days-of-Week can be specified
as values between 1 and 7 (1 = Sunday) or by using the strings SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI and SAT.

The '/' character can be used to specify increments to values. For example, if you put '0/15' in the Minutes
field, it means 'every 15th minute of the hour, starting at minute zero'. If you used '3/20' in the Minutes field, it
would mean 'every 20th minute of the hour, starting at minute three' - or in other words it is the same as specifying
'3,23,43' in the Minutes field.  Note the subtlety that "*/35" does *not* mean "every 35 minutes" - it mean
"every 35th minute of the hour, starting at minute zero" - or in other words the same as specifying '0,35'.

The '?' character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields. It is used to specify "no specific
value". This is useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields, but not the other. See the examples
below (and CronTrigger JavaDoc) for clarification.

The 'L' character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields. This character is short-hand for
"last", but it has different meaning in each of the two fields. For example, the value "L" in the day-of-month field
means "the last day of the month" - day 31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the
day-of-week field by itself, it simply means "7" or "SAT". But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it
means "the last xxx day of the month" - for example "6L" or "FRIL" both mean "the last friday of the month".  You
can also specify an offset from the last day of the month, such as "L-3" which would mean the third-to-last day of the
calendar month. *When using the 'L' option, it is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you'll get
confusing/unexpected results.*

The 'W' is used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. As an example, if you were to
specify "15W" as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: "the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month".

The '#' is used to specify "the nth" XXX weekday of the month. For example, the value of "6#3" or "FRI#3" in the
day-of-week field means "the third Friday of the month".

Here are a few more examples of expressions and their meanings - you can find even more in the JavaDoc for
org.quartz.CronExpression

### Example Cron Expressions {#TutorialLesson6-ExampleCronExpressions}

CronTrigger Example 1 - an expression to create a trigger that simply fires every 5 minutes

"0 0/5 * * * ?"



CronTrigger Example 2 - an expression to create a trigger that fires every 5 minutes, at 10 seconds after the minute
(i.e. 10:00:10 am, 10:05:10 am, etc.).

"10 0/5 * * * ?"



CronTrigger Example 3 - an expression to create a trigger that fires at 10:30, 11:30, 12:30, and 13:30, on every
Wednesday and Friday.

"0 30 10-13 ? * WED,FRI"



CronTrigger Example 4 - an expression to create a trigger that fires every half hour between the hours of 8 am and 10 am
on the 5th and 20th of every month. Note that the trigger will NOT fire at 10:00 am, just at 8:00, 8:30, 9:00 and 9:30

"0 0/30 8-9 5,20 * ?"



Note that some scheduling requirements are too complicated to express with a single trigger - such as "every 5 minutes
between 9:00 am and 10:00 am, and every 20 minutes between 1:00 pm and 10:00 pm". The solution in this scenario is to
simply create two triggers, and register both of them to run the same job.

### Building CronTriggers {#TutorialLesson6-ExampleCronExpressions}

CronTrigger instances are built using TriggerBuilder (for the trigger's main properties) and CronScheduleBuilder
(for the CronTrigger-specific properties).  To use these builders in a DSL-style, use static imports:


<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">
import static org.quartz.TriggerBuilder.*;
import static org.quartz.CronScheduleBuilder.*;
import static org.quartz.DateBuilder.*:
</code></pre>


**Build a trigger that will fire every other minute, between 8am and 5pm, every day:**

<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">
  trigger = newTrigger()
    .withIdentity("trigger3", "group1")
    .withSchedule(cronSchedule("0 0/2 8-17 * * ?"))
    .forJob("myJob", "group1")
    .build();
</code></pre>


**Build a trigger that will fire daily at 10:42 am:**

<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">
  trigger = newTrigger()
    .withIdentity("trigger3", "group1")
    .withSchedule(dailyAtHourAndMinute(10, 42))
    .forJob(myJobKey)
    .build();
</code></pre>

or -

<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">
  trigger = newTrigger()
    .withIdentity("trigger3", "group1")
    .withSchedule(cronSchedule("0 42 10 * * ?"))
    .forJob(myJobKey)
    .build();
</code></pre>



**Build a trigger that will fire on Wednesdays at 10:42 am, in a TimeZone other than the system's default:**

<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">
  trigger = newTrigger()
    .withIdentity("trigger3", "group1")
    .withSchedule(weeklyOnDayAndHourAndMinute(DateBuilder.WEDNESDAY, 10, 42))
    .forJob(myJobKey)
    .inTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone("America/Los_Angeles"))
    .build();
</code></pre>

or -

<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">
  trigger = newTrigger()
    .withIdentity("trigger3", "group1")
    .withSchedule(cronSchedule("0 42 10 ? * WED"))
    .inTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone("America/Los_Angeles"))
    .forJob(myJobKey)
    .build();
</code></pre>


### CronTrigger Misfire Instructions {#TutorialLesson6-CronTriggerMisfireInstructions}

The following instructions can be used to inform Quartz what it should do when a misfire occurs for CronTrigger.
(Misfire situations were introduced in the More About Triggers section of this tutorial). These instructions are defined
as constants on CronTrigger itself (including JavaDoc describing their behavior). The instructions include:

**Misfire Instruction Constants of CronTrigger**


<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">
MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_IGNORE_MISFIRE_POLICY
MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_DO_NOTHING
MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_FIRE_NOW
</code></pre>


All triggers also have the *Trigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_SMART_POLICY* instruction available for use, and
this instruction is also the default for all trigger types. The 'smart policy' instruction is interpreted by CronTrigger
as *MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_FIRE_NOW.* The JavaDoc for the CronTrigger.updateAfterMisfire() method explains the exact
details of this behavior.

When building CronTriggers, you specify the misfire instruction as part of the simple schedule
(via CronSchedulerBuilder):


<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">
  trigger = newTrigger()
    .withIdentity("trigger3", "group1")
    .withSchedule(cronSchedule("0 0/2 8-17 * * ?")
        ..withMisfireHandlingInstructionFireAndProceed())
    .forJob("myJob", "group1")
    .build();
</code></pre>
